# PWA Text Editor


## Description

JATE is the name of this text editor, which stands for just another text editor! If you want to type in anything in here like sample code or like a code snippet, it will auto save, so if you refresh the page, your code won't go anywhere! Since it is a progressive web app, you can also install it as an app for better user experience.

## Installation

To be able to install the project after doing a git clone, the following is needed to install packages and/or dependencies:
~~~
npm run start
~~~

However, if you are using the Heroku link, no command is needed to install. If you want to install it as a Chrome/browser app however since it is a progressive web app, you can click on the install button on the top left-hand corner and accept the prompt to install. 


## Contribution

The starter code was provided by UNC as part of the Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp, but anicrob filled in any spots of code where it mentions "TO DO:". Also had assistance from LAs for troubleshooting minor bugs.
